# BMI Calculator - Emanuela Sîrcă (Tudose)

BMI Calculator is a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It is a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.

I created this application following the officially recommended course by Flutter found on [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart).

The BMI Calculator application can be found in the 12th section of the course.
